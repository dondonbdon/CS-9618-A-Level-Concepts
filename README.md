# Computer Science A Level Concepts
The code in this program is intended to be applicable to those who intend to take Paper 4 Computer Science(9618) on the Cambridge Assessment International Examinations board or wherever you may see fit to use it.
This is a repository containing a few of the concepts that are needed for one to understand what goes on in a Paper 4.


Namely: 
1. [Binary Tree](binary_tree_algorithm.py)\n
   In the binary tree file you will see steps as to how you can create a binary tree using a class.
   You will also create functions where you can do an insert, an inorder traversal of the tree, a preorder traversal of the tree and finally a post order
   traversal of the tree
   
2. [Classes](classes_algorithm.py)\n
   In the classes program you will see steps as to how you can implement a class in python.
   You will see steps as to how you can create a class and its object, also how you can access it's data. You will also learn more advanced topics such as 
   constructor functions, getters and setters and inheritance.
   
3. [Files](files_algorithm.py)\n
   In the files program you will learn about files.
   You will see how in a file you will have to create a class to match outputs for the data inside of the file.
   You will extract and manipulate the data inside of the file. Learn about opening files in different modes. 

4. [Queue(ADT)](queue_algorithm.py)\n
   In the queues program you will learn how to implement the abstract data type, the queue.
   You will see steps as to which pointers are created and how they are created also the enqueue and dequeue functions.
   
5. Linked List(ADT) - Coming Soon!

6. [Recursion](recursion_algorithm.py)\n
   In the recursion program you will learn about recursion.
   The program has about 3 tasks that will be done with an iterative solution and a recursive solution so as to compare the functions and the outputs.  
   
7. [Searching](searching_algorithms.py)\n
   In the searching program you will go through how to search for a value in an array
   There's two main ways of searching, namely, the binary search and the linear search, we will go through all of them in the program and how you can 
   implement them in your code.   
   
8. [Sorting](sorting_algorithms.py)\n
    In the sorting program you will go through how to sort values in an array
    There's also two main ways of sorting values in an array, namely the bubble sort and the insertion sort. The code will perform these sortings in anscending
    and in descending order.    
    
9. [Stack (ADT)](stack_algorithm.py)\n
    In the stack program you will learn how to implement the abstract data type, the stack.
    You will see steps as to which pointers are created and how they are created, and also the push and pop functions.

10. [Operators & Math](operators_math_algorithms.py)\n
    In the operators algorithms program you will learn about different opereators.
    You will learn that in python theres a few operators that you can use in programs to perform calculations.
    You will learn about the math library and its useful functions.

11. [Random](random_algorithms.py)\n
    In this program you will see an assortment of useful and random programs that will help you learn programming etcetra.

Please use these programs as you see fit.
Do understand i am still learning and may have made a mistake somewhere or there may be easier ways to do some code do not hesitate to create your pull requests.
